time challenge

a one minute timer counts down. the player with the highest pet rating/score wins.

* petting increases the score
* different petting zones increment the score at different rates
* petting zone values fluctuate throughout challenge. kitty will get tired of chin tickles and score will not go up.

- visual indicator of kitty's zone preference/annoyance level
- cursor changes depending on zone: pat-pat hand for head and back, coochi-coo for underparts, pokey finger for other.
- also there is a DO NOT PET zone mode which will decrease score if touched
